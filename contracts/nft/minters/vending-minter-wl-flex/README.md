# Terp Vending Minter with Flexible Earlybird Contract

A vending minter designed to have a flexible earlybird. The earlybird is generated from a snapshot of an existing collection to give a per address limit based on existing NFT ownership.

This removes 3% earlybird limit. It only works with earlybird-flex.
